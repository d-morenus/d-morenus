- Hi, I’m @d-morenus
- I’m interested in writing web applications, generative programming, 3D printing, hybrid AI with deep learning, microcontrollers, and robotics.
- I am highly experienced in Java, Javascript, SQL, Spring/Hibernate, HTML, CSS, and good software development practices. I enjoy Python and Ruby on Rails. I know the ancient languages FORTRAN, LISP, BASIC, C, SmallTalk, Ada, and assembler, but I am more inclined to program an Arduino than my Commodore 64.
- I’m currently learning whatever I need to get the current job done, as well as indulging my ecclectic autodidactivity.
- I am mildly interested in making obscene amounts of money, but seek work/life balance.
- To reach me, leave a message on my cellphone, and I'll listen to it next year when I'm on vacation.
