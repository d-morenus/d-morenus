- 👋 Hi, I’m @d-morenus
- 👀 I’m interested in writing web applications, generative programming, 3D printing, hybrid AI with deep learning, and robotics.
- I am highly experienced in Java, Javascript, SQL, Spring/Hibernate, HTML, CSS, and good software development practices. I enjoy Python and Ruby on Rails. I am experienced in many old technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever I need to get the next job done, as well as indulging my ecclectic autodidactivity.
